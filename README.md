# homework5 - Josh Herd Day Planner

Description: 
This application is a personal day planner that allows the user to enter and save hourly tasks and plan their day. When the user opens the application the current date and time are displayed near the top of the screen. A table below has repeating elements to display the day in hourly blocks, with respective text input fields where the user can specify appointments. Rows within the table are colored based on the time of day to indicate if the time block is in the past (colored gray), present (colored red), or future (colored green). When the user enters a task into a text field and presses the save button, the information is captured in the local storage of the users browser, allowing it to persist on that machine through page refresh and reopening.

All coding was completed by Josh Herd and utilizes Google Fonts, Font Awesome, and the Bootstrap framework for styling. Program logic contains both vanilla JavaScript and JQuery functionality.
